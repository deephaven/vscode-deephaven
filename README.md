# Deephaven VS Code Extension

This is the official Deephaven extension for Visual Studio Code. Use it to run queries against running Deephaven servers from VS Code directly. The extension supports both Deephaven [Community](https://deephaven.io/core/docs/) and [Enterprise](https://deephaven.io/enterprise/docs/) servers.

## About Deephaven

[Deephaven](https://deephaven.io/) is a high-performance time-series database, complemented by a full suite of APIs and an intuitive user experience. Deephaven integrates with Java / Groovy, Python, R, C#, and C++ applications and libraries, as well as open-source data and ML technologies. It is a complete data system that empowers your team to build analyses, models, algos, reports, and dashboards very quickly. It excels at churning through massive real-time data sets, and performing analysis on historical or alternative data sets.

## Installation

Install the Deephaven VS Code extension from one of two places:

- The [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=deephaven.vscode-deephaven)
- VS Code's built-in extension browser

A search for `Deephaven` in either place will yield the Deephaven VS Code extension as the first result.
