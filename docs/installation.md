# Deephaven VS Code - Installation

Install the Deephaven VS Code extension from one of two places:

- The [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=deephaven.vscode-deephaven)
- VS Code's built-in extension browser

A search for `Deephaven` in either place will yield the Deephaven VS Code extension as the first result.

Once installed, the Deephaven icon will show up in the activity bar on the left side of VS Code:

By default, the extension is only configured to connect to a single Community server hosted at `http://localhost:10000`. See more about adding, removing, and updating servers in the [Configuration](#configuration) section below.
